                <h1><b><u>TC Outsiders</u></b></h1>
                <p>
                    At T.C. Outsiders, we strive to bring you photo slides of some of our favorite spots in Northern Michigan as well as our favorite hangouts.
                    Every year Traverse City is in the news and the national media, advertising its splendor and becoming ever more popular.  We here at TCO believe
                    that this spotlight is overshadowing the surrounding communities leaving them widely ignored and we aim to change that.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While it is true that all the towns featured in our site are popular tourist destinations, most still do not even realize they exist, instead going for the more familiar large city of Traverse.
                    There is much more to Northern Michigan than the mall, and we hope that we can prove this and get you away from the massive shopping complex we collectively call T.C.
                    and into the areas that make up north truly great.
                </p>
                <h1><b><u>Future Additions To Site</u></b></h1>

                <p>
                    In the future, if the TCO team stays together, we will feature many more cities and even provide Google map directions to each slide as well as a host of other things such
                    as blogs and forums for each town and village, and a place for restaurant reviews.  For now, enjoy the color tour shots in our Frankfort page taken by our very own Blaine Simcox
                    and check out the restaurants we have specially selected for our currently completed towns.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It will also be incorporated so that all towns have individual event calendars so that you can see where all the fun is at for our area on any given day.
                    Of course, this will depend massively on the continuation of this project, so feedback as to continue will be helpful in deciding to pursue this project further.
                    Enjoy.
                </p>
